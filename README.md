# Barliman API
A really terrible, awful, horrible, api for using [Barliman.](https://github.com/webyrd/Barliman) Made for my iOS 
development class where I am making an iOS port of Barliman. It turns Barliman into a MacOS CLI app, so it can only be
hosted on mac servers currently...

# Future
A better version of this API is planned for the future. I will probably recreate most of what they are doing in Swift
in a server side language and provide better error handling. I had to remove some of the error handling to get this 
working in a week.

Hope to someday have a web version of Barliman hitting an API that can be scaled with Docker. But that could be a way off.
